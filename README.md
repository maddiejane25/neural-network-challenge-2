Module 19 Challenge

## Overview
In this challenge, I assessed a dataset looking at the attrition data of employees at a company. The model is trained to predict the attrition (departure or resignation of an employee) and departments that may be prone to attrition. There were 10 features used to train the model including: age, distance from home, education, job satisfaction, overtime, stock option level, work life balance, years at the company, and years since last promotion. 

## Usage
Please run code in Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio. Errors arose with training the model using Google Colab.

## Conclusions
The model was better at predicting attrition of the employees (accuracy 84%) over the departments that may see the most attrition (accuracy 39%).

## Acknowledgements
My Python file was created using Google Colab with help from the XPert Learning Assistant, although please use Jupyter notebook to run the code.
